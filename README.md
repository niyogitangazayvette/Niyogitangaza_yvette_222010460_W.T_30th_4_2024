A general overview of how your Online House Selling Management System (OHSMS) works:
1.	User Registration: Users can sign up for an account on the platform. They provide necessary details such as name, email, mobile number, security question, and address. Upon registration, users are assigned roles such as buyer, seller, or administrator.
2.	House Listing: Sellers can list their properties for sale on the platform. They provide information about the house, including its unique identifier (UPI number), description, price, location, and optionally, images. Each listed house is associated with the seller's account.
3.	House Search and Viewing: Buyers can browse through the listed houses using search filters such as location, price range, and features. They can view detailed information about each property, including description, price, location, and images. Buyers can also save their favorite listings for future reference.
4.	Buying Process: When a buyer decides to purchase a house, they can initiate the buying process through the platform. They may submit an offer or directly purchase the property, depending on the seller's preferences. The system facilitates communication between buyers and sellers during negotiations.
5.	Payment and Transaction Management: Once a deal is finalized, the system handles the payment process securely. Buyers make payments for the purchased properties through integrated payment gateways. The system tracks payment status and updates the transaction records accordingly.
6.	Administrator Dashboard: Administrators have access to a dashboard where they can manage user accounts, oversee house listings, and handle any disputes or issues that may arise. They can also monitor transaction records and ensure compliance with platform policies.
7.	Advertisement Management: The system offers advertising services for real estate agents or agencies to promote their services or listings. Advertisements can be targeted based on user demographics, location, and search behavior to maximize effectiveness.
8.	User Authentication and Security: The system ensures secure user authentication and data protection measures to safeguard user information and transactions. It may employ technologies such as HTTPS, encryption, and secure authentication protocols to enhance security.
9.	Feedback and Reviews: After completing a transaction, buyers and sellers can leave feedback and reviews for each other, contributing to the platform's reputation system. Positive reviews can enhance trust and credibility among users.
10.	Continuous Improvement: The system continuously collects user feedback and usage data to improve its features, usability, and performance over time. Regular updates and enhancements ensure that the platform remains competitive and meets users' evolving needs.
